# Repository Agent Instructions

## Git Workflow (Mandatory)
- Never merge directly into `main`.
- Always create a working branch with prefix `codex/`.
- Always push the branch and open a Pull Request to `main`.
- Stop after creating the PR and wait for user approval before any merge.
- If a merge is explicitly requested, reconfirm once before merging.

## Default Delivery Style
- Prefer small, reviewable commits.
- Include clear test steps in PR description.
- Keep README and docs updated when behavior changes.
